Imagine you have a big data set, but you need to whittle it down by some sort of criteria.
For example, let's say you are building a game night app that stores player information after every game or session.
One of the main features might be tracking which players improve the most from week to week.
But to get that info, you need to iterate through the entire data set, perform a calculation and then somehow end up with a filtered list of players that meet the requirement.
Write a function that calculates and returns three different tip percentages for meal.
