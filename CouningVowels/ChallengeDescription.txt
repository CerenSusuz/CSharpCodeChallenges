Imagine your program needs to store a pair of values.
The most common way to do this is with a Dictionary.
But once you add your data into that dictionary, how do you efficiently is a key exists and grab its values?
Write a function that takes any word or sentence and assigns points based on each vowel and how many times it appears.

Criteria 
A is worth 1 points
E is worth 2 points
I is worth 3 points
O is worth 4 points
U is worth 5 points
Y is worth 9 points
