Imagine you and your friends have a fantasy league or something like that and what to know how your stats stack up.
You have the raw data in terms of scores for each game but that doesn't necessarily give you the values you want. 
In many cases, the data needs to be ordered, computed and represented in a specific way.
Write a function that takes a list of scores and compute the lowest and highest values, as well as the sum and average of all scores.
