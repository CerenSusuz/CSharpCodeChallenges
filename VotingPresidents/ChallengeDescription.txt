Imagine you are building an app that calculates how many times a milestone in your life has happened.
Like being promoted, adopting a pet, or even voting for president. 
Your goal here is to write a C# function that takes in a person's age and prints out how many times they voted for president. 
The function is going to take in an integer value and return the number of presidents they voted for as an integer value as well.
